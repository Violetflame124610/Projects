# Ultrasonic Radar
This Projects helps in building an ultrasonic radar which teaches fundamental principles of electronics, programming (microcontrollers, serial communication), physics (sound waves, echolocation), and data visualization, bridging hardware with software to create a functional object detection system.

## Materials
- Arduino
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- USB cable for injecting of code to arduino
## Applicaions we will be using
- Arduino IDE
- Processing 3
## Circuit
Connect your components as shown below in the cirucit diagram.

## Code Injection
Enter the code in arduino ide and inject it to arduino and do not remove the plug.Now, add the code to processing3 and run the code, the code will run and show some display as shown below.
